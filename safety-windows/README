== Finding an alpha safe path in a DAG ==

First implementation, the DAG is (for now) given as adjacency list.
An alpha safe path is an s--t path which contains all edges which are part of
> [alpha * (amount of paths)] paths. For alpha >= 0.5, this is well defined.
The DAG corresponds to all optimal alignments, and p path in this DAG
corresponds to one specifig choice of optimal alignment. The edges correspond
to the matching of two symbols.
